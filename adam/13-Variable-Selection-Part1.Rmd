# Model Selection: What is the right number of regressors we should include?

Variable selection is intended to (objectively) find the "best" subset of predictors. So why not throw the whole kitchen sink into our model?

# Motivating Example: Predicting Life Expectancy

The `state` datasets in the base R package (no package needed to access the data) contains various data sets with data from all 50 states. We'll be working with the dataset `state.x77` which has 50 observations (one for each state) with the following variables of interest:

- `Population`: Population estimate as of July 1, 1975
- `Income`: Per capita income (1974)
- `Illiteracy`: Illiteracy rate (1970, percent of population)
- `Life Exp`: life expectancy in years (1969–71)
- `Murder`: murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate per 100,000 population (1976)
- `HS Grad`: percent high-school graduates (1970)
- `Frost`: mean number of days with minimum temperature below freezing (1931–1960) in capital or large city
- `Area`: land area in square miles

## Loading the Data

```{r}
data(state)
statedata <- data.frame(state.x77, row.names = state.abb)
#head(statedata)
summary(statedata)
```

**Which regressors should we include if we want to predict `Life Exp` as the response variable?**

## Question 1: Why might it be a bad a idea to simply include all regressors?



## Question 2: What metrics/methods have we used to compare models thus far?


# Variable Selection

There are two aspects to variable selection:

- The strategy used to search for the "optimal" model.
- The criterion used to compare models.

# Testing-Based Procedures

## Backward elimination

**Backward elimination** is the simplest of all variable selection procedures. We start with all predictors and remove the least significant predictor. Stop once all the noise has been removed.

## Question 3: Which of the predictors would you remove from the full model? What criteria did you use to make that decision?

```{r}
lmod <- lm(Life.Exp ~ ., data = statedata)
faraway::sumary(lmod)
```



```{r}
back1 <- update(lmod, . ~ . - Area)
faraway::sumary(back1)
```


- This does not imply the other variables are not related to the response.

```{r}
lmod1 <- lm(Life.Exp ~ Illiteracy, data = statedata)
faraway::sumary(lmod1)
```

## Forward Selection

**Forward selection** starts with the null model (only an intercept), and adds regressors one at a time until we can no longer improve the error criterion by adding a single regressor. 

- For example, first add the predictor with the smallest $p$-value.
- Then compare models with the first predictor plus a second predictor and add the predictor which has the smallest $p$-value.

## Stepwise Regression

**Stepwise regression** is a combination of backward elimination and forward selection.

- This addresses the situation where variables are added or removed early in the process and we want to change our mind.
Stepwise selection can miss the optimal model because we do not consider all possible models due to the one-at-a-time nature of adding/removing regressors.
- $p$-values should not be taken as very accurate in stepwise searches because we are bound to see small $p$-values due to chance alone.
- Stepwise selection tends to produce simpler models that are not necessarily the best for prediction.

## Model Hierarchy

We must respect hierarchy in models when it is naturally present.

- In polynomial models, $X^2$ is a higher order term than $X$.
- A lower order term should be retained if a higher order term is retained to increase the flexibility.
	- The model $Y=\beta_0+\beta_2 X^2+\epsilon$, the maximum/minimum value MUST occur $x=0$ 
  - For the model $y=\beta_0+\beta_1 X+\beta_2 X^2+\epsilon$, the maximum/minimum value can occur anywhere along the real line (depending on what the data suggest).
- If we fit the model $y=\beta_0+\beta_1 X+\beta_2 X^2+\epsilon$ and $\beta_1$ is not significant, it would NOT make sense to remove $X$ from the model but still keep $X^2$.

# Criterion-Based Procedures

**Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)** and the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** are two information-based criteria for variable selection.

## Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)

$\mbox{AIC}(\mathcal{M})=-2L(\mathcal{M})+2p_{\mathcal{M}}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the model, $L(\mathcal{M})$ is the **log-likelihood** of the model using the **MLE** estimates of the parameters, and $p_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the number of regression coefficients in model $\mathcal{M}$.

For linear regression models, $-2L(\mathcal{M})=n\log{(\mbox{RSS}_{\mathcal{M}}/n)} + c$, where $c$ is a constant that depends only on the observed data and not on the model, and $\mbox{RSS}_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the RSS of model $\mathcal{M}$. The constant $c$ is the same for a given data set, so they can be ignored when comparing models that based on the same data set.

### Interpreting AIC

The formula for AIC is derived from a metric that can be used to measure how far a model is from the true model.

- As $\mbox{RSS}_{\mathcal{M}}$ gets smaller (better fit), $n\log{(\mbox{RSS}_{\mathcal{M}}/n)}$ gets smaller (becomes more negative).
  - Adding more predictors (that are not collinear) will improve the fit.
- As $p_{\mathcal{M}}$ gets bigger, the second term of AIC gets larger.
  - The second component penalizes the model according its complexity.
  - The more parameters, the larger the penalty.
- Models with more parameters will fit better (reducing the RSS), but will be penalized more for having additional parameters.
- AIC provides a balance between fit and simplicity.
  - AIC identifies good fitting models (small RSS) that are simple (not a lot of predictors).
- **We choose the model the minimizes the AIC**.

### Exhaustive Model Searches

The `leaps` package searches all possible combinations of predictors. 

- For each value of $p$ (number of predictors), it finds the variables that give the minimum RSS.
- For each value of $p$, the model that minimizes the RSS will have the smallest AIC, BIC, adjusted $R_a^2$, and Mallow’s $C_p$ (we'll discuss these soon).
- By default, `regsubsets` only goes up to $p=9$.  You have to set `nvmax = j`, where $j$ is the number of regressors you want to consider.


```{r}
# may need to install.package the first time
library(leaps) # you need to load package every time you want to use it

# model selection by exhaustive search
b <- regsubsets(Life.Exp ~ ., data = statedata)
rs <- summary(b) # summarize model that minimizes RSS for each p
rs$which # nicer output
```


## Question 4: Interpret the output from the code above. Is this consistent with the model we obtained using backward elimination?


### Computing the AIC

```{r}
# What output is stored after running regsubsets
summary(rs)
```

```{r}
n <- nrow(statedata) #number observation n=50
rss <- rs$rss # rss calculated for each model

# Compute AIC using the formula
AIC <- n * log(rss/n) + (2:8)*2  # we start at 2 since include intercept in all
plot(AIC ~ I(1:7), ylab = "AIC", xlab = "Number of Predictors", pch = 16)
```


### Question 5: Interpret the output from the AIC plots above. What is the best model according to this metric?

## Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is another criteria that is often and is almost the same as AIC.


$$BIC(\mathcal{M})=-2L(\mathcal{M})+\log{(n)}p_{\mathcal{M}}.$$


```{r}
(BIC <- rs$bic) # Exactly values from rs summary
#(BIC2 <- n * log(rss/n) + log(n)* (2:8))  # Using the formula
#BIC - BIC2 # The two differ by a constant
plot(BIC ~ I(1:7), ylab = "BIC", xlab = "Number of Predictors", pch = 16)
```

## Question 6: Interpret the output from the BIC plot above. What is the best model according to this metric?


- The `car` package has a `subsets` function that takes the generates nice, labeled BIC plots generated from the `regsubsets` function.

```{r}
library(car)
subsets(b, statistic = "bic", legend = FALSE)
```

# Appendix

## Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE)

The **likelihood function** $L(\theta)= L( \theta \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)$ gives the likelihood of the parameter $\theta$ given the observed data. A **maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)**, $\mathbf{\hat{\theta}_{\rm MLE}}$,}} is
a value of $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood function.

**MLE is a process for finding the best parameter(s) for a model based on a given dataset**


Let $f(x; \theta)$ denote the pdf of a random variable $X$ with associated parameter $\theta$. Suppose $X_1, X_2, \ldots , X_n$ are random samples from this distribution, and $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n$ are the
corresponding observed values.

$$ L(\theta \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n) = f(x_1; \theta) f(x_2; \theta) \ldots f(x_n; \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta).$$

### Example: Finding and MLE

Find the MLE for $\lambda$ where $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n$ comes from $X \sim \mbox{Exp}(\lambda)$ with $f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$.

1. Find a formula for the likelihood function.

$$ L(\lambda \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n) = \left(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_1} \right)\left(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_2} \right) \ldots \left(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_n} \right) = \lambda^n e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i} .$$

2. Optimize the likelihood function. Find the value of $\lambda$ that makes the observed data most likely to occur.

$$\frac{d}{d \lambda} \left( \lambda^n e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i} \right) $$

Often this is really messy to solve. Taking the natural log of both sides often simplifies the calculation.

The **log-likelihood** function is $y = \ln{L(\theta \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n) }$ (often written with $\log$ though we mean $\ln$).

 - Since the natural log is an increasing function, the value of $\theta$ that maximizes (or minimizes) $L(\theta \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n)$ is the same value of $\theta$ that maximizes (or minimizes) $y = \ln{L(\theta \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n) }$.
 
$$y = \ln{\left(\lambda^n e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\right)} = n \ln{(\lambda)}- \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$
It actually is easier to optimize the log-likelihood function in this case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{d \lambda} \ln{\left(\lambda^n e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\right)} &= \frac{d}{d \lambda} \left( n \ln{(\lambda)}- \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \\
&= \frac{n}{\lambda} - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
\end{aligned}
$$

We have a critical value at $\lambda = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} = \bar{x}$ which is the value of $\lambda$ that maximizes the likelihood function. If we assume the sample was randomly selected from an exponential distribution, then given the observed data, the most likely value for $\lambda$ is $\bar{x}$. This makes practical sense since if $X \sim \mbox{Exp}(\lambda)$, $E(X) = \mu = \lambda$.

### Pros of Using MLE's to Estimate Population Parameters

- MLE's give estimates that make practical sense (see example above).
- **Consistency**: As the sample size gets larger and larger, MLE's converge to the actual value of the parameter.
- **Normality**: As we get more data, MLE's converge to a normal distribution.
- **Efficiency**: They have the smallest possible variance for a consistent estimator.
