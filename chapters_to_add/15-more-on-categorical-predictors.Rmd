# More on categorical predictors

Categorical  predictors can greatly improve the explanatory power or predictive capability of a fitted model when different patterns exist for different levels of the categorical variables. In what follows, we consider several common linear regression models that involve a categorical variable. To simplify our discussion, we only consider the setting where there is a single categorical variable to add to our model. Similarly, we only consider the setting where there is a single numeric variable.

We begin by defining some notation.

Let $X$ denote a numeric regressor, with $x_i$ denoting the value of $X$ for observation $i$.

Let $F$ denote a categorical variable with levels $L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_K$. The $F$ stands for "factor", while the $L$ stands for "level". The notation $f_i$ denotes the value of $F$ for observation $i$. 

## Indicator/dummy variables

We may recall that if $\mathbf{X}$ denotes our matrix of regressors and $\mathbf{y}$ our vector of responses, then (assuming the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ are linearly independent) the OLS solution for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is $$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}.$$ In order to compute the estimated coefficients, both $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ must contain numeric values. How can we use a categorical predictor in our regression model when the levels are not numeric values? In order to use a categorical predictor in a regression model, we must transform it into a set of one or more **indicator** or **dummy variables**, which we explain in more detail below.

An **indicator function** is a function that takes the value 1 of a certain property is true and 0 otherwise. An indicator variable is the variable that results from applying an indicator function to each observation in a data set. Many notations exist for indicator functions. We will adopt the notation 

\begin{equation*}
I_S(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if}\;x \in S\\
0 & \textrm{if}\;x \notin S
\end{cases},
\end{equation*}

which is shorthand for a function that returns 1 if $x$ is in the set $S$ and 0 otherwise. 

We let $D_j$ denote the indicator (dummy) variable for factor level $L_j$ of $F$. The value of $D_j$ for observation $i$ is denoted $d_{i,j}$, with $$d_{i,j} = I_{\{L_j\}}(f_i),$$ i.e., $d_{i,j}$ is 1 if observation $i$ has factor level $L_j$ and 0 otherwise.

## Common of linear models with categorical predictors

It is common to use notation like $E(Y|X_1, X_2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 +\beta_2 X_2$ when discussing linear regression models. That notation is generally simple and convenient, but can be unclear. Asking a researcher what the estimate of $\beta_2$ is in a model is ambiguous because it will depend on the order the researcher added the variables to the model. To more closely connect each coefficient with the regressor to which it is related, we will use the notation $\beta_X$ to denote the coefficient for regressor $X$ and $\beta_{D_j}$ to denote the coefficient for regressor $D_j$. Similarly, $\beta_{int}$ denotes the intercept included in our model.

### One-way ANOVA

#### Definition

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) assumes a constant mean for each level of a categorical variable. A general one-way ANOVA relating a response variable $Y$ to a factor variable $F$ with $K$ levels may be formulated as $$E(Y|F) = \beta_{int} + \beta_{D_2} D_2 + \ldots + \beta_{D_K} D_K.$$ Alternatively, in terms of the individual responses, we may formulate the one-way ANOVA  model as 
$$Y_i = \beta_{int} + \beta_{D_2} d_{i,2} + \cdots + \beta_{D_K} d_{i,K} + \epsilon_i,\quad i=1,2,\ldots n.$$ 

This may bring up some questions that need answering.

*Why does the one-way ANOVA model only contains dummy variables for the last $K-1$ levels of $F$?* This is not a mistake. If we included dummy variables for all levels of $F$, then the matrix of regressors would have linearly dependent columns because the sum of the dummy variables for all $K$ levels would equal the column of 1s for the intercept.

*Why do we omit the dummy variable for the first level of $F$?* This is simply convention. We could omit the dummy variable for any single level of $F$. However, it is conventional to designate one level the reference level and to omit that variable. As we will see when discussing interpretation of the coefficient, the reference level becomes the level of $F$ that all other levels are compared to.

*Could we omit the intercept instead of one of the dummy variables?* Yes, you could. There is no mathematical or philosophical issues with this. However, this can create problems when you construct models including both categorical and numeric regressors. The standard approach is recommended because it typically makes our model easier to interpret and extend.

#### Interpretation

We interpret the coefficients of our one-way ANOVA with respect to the change in the mean response.

Suppose an observation of level $L_1$. We can determine that the mean response is 

\begin{align*}
E(Y|F=L_1) &= \beta_{int} + \beta_{D_2} 0 + \cdots + \beta_{D_K} 0 \\
&= \beta_{int}.
\end{align*}

Similarly, when an observation has level $L_2$, then 
\begin{align*}
E(Y|F=L_2) &= \beta_{int} + \beta_{D_2} 1 + \beta_{D_3} 0 + \cdots + \beta_{D_K} 0 \\
&= \beta_{int} + \beta_{D_2}.
\end{align*}
This helps us to see the general relationship that
$$E(Y|F=L_j) = \beta_{int} + \beta_{D_j},\quad j=2,\ldots,K.$$
 In the context of a one-way ANOVA:

* $\beta_{int}$ represents the expected response for observations having the reference level.
* $\beta_{L_j}$, for $j=2,\ldots,K$, represents the expected change in the response when comparing observations having the reference level and level $L_j$. 
  * You can verify this by computing $E(Y|F=L_j) - E(Y|F=L_1)$ (for $j = 2, \ldots, K$).

### Main effects models


### Interaction models 

An interaction model is also called a separate lines model since the regression equations for each factor level produce lines that are distinct and separate.

### Extensions

In the models above, we have only discussed possibilities with a single numeric variable and a single factor variable. Naturally, one can consider models with multiple factor variables, multiple numeric variables, interactions between factor variables, interactions between numeric variables, etc. The models become more complicated, but the ideas are similar. One simply has to keep track of what role each coefficient plays in the model.


<!-- We could fit other ANCOVA models, such as the common intercept model, but the parallel lines and separate lines models are the most common. -->

<!-- You can add additional interactions, squared and cubic explanatory variables to the model, etc. -->

## Exploring Data for One-Factor Models: Example with United Nations Dataset

### 1. Load the `UN11` dataset below and read the help documentation to familiarize yourself with the data. How many observations are in the dataset? How many variables?

```{r}
data(UN11)
# ?UN11
```

```{r}
nrow(UN11)
ncol(UN11)
head(UN11)
```
There are 199 observations (countries) with 6 variables.

We'll be working with following variables.

- **ppgdp**: the gross national product per person in U.S. dollars
- **fertility**: Average number of children per birth parent
- **lifeExpF**: Female life expectancy, years
- **pctUrban**: A percentage of population living in urban areas
- **group**: A factor with level **oecd** for countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are located in **africa**, and **other** for all other countries.

If the only predictor is a factor, then the regression model is called a **one-factor** or **one-way** design.

```{r}
levels(UN11$group)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 2. Create side-by-side boxplots for the variable **lifeExpF** for each of the categories of the **group** variable and describe any interesting observations about the data.

```{r}
boxplot(lifeExpF ~ group, data = UN11) 
```

- The oecd countries generally have the largest female life expectancy and africa countries typically have the lowest.  
- Nauru and Afghanistan have unusually low female life expectancy for the other group.  
- Japan has high female life expectancy, and Turkey has low life expectancy compared to the other members of the oecd.  
- The variation of female life expectancy in oecd is smallest, but in africa is largest.

**Tips on reading boxplots:**  

- The thick middle line indicates the median value.
- The box extends to the 25th and 75th percentiles.  The distance between the quartiles is known as the interquartile range (IQR).
- The whiskers generally extend to the most extreme values that are within 1.5 IQRs from the quartiles.
- Values outside the whiskers are outliers and are indicated by a dot or star.

## How do we include factor variables as regressors?

**Dummy** or **indicator variables** are used to include categorical predictors in a regression model.

- A dummy variable $U_j$ for factor level $j$ is 1 if an observation has level $j$, but $0$ otherwise.
- Note that -1 and 1, or 1 and 2, are sometimes used, but this is less common and more difficult to interpret.
- Assignment labels are mostly arbitrary and do not affect the results.

Since group has $d=3$ levels, the $j^{\mbox{th}}$ dummy variable $U_j$ for the factor $j=1,2, \ldots,d$ has $i^{\mbox{th}}$ value $u_{ij}$, for $i=1,2, \ldots,n$ given by 

$$u_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \mbox{if } \mbox{group}_i=j^{\mbox{th}} \mbox{ category of group} \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$

For the **group** variable, we set up three dummy variables

- $U_1$ (is country OECD?), 
- $U_2$ (is country Other?), and 
- $U_3$ (is country in Africa?).

### 3. Explain what the code below is doing? What happens if we remove the $+ 0$ from the commands?

```{r}
# with functions means: using this data frame, 
# perform the following actions ...
U1 <- with(UN11, (group == levels(group)[1]) + 0) 
U2 <- with(UN11, (group == levels(group)[2]) + 0)
U3 <- with(UN11, (group == levels(group)[3]) + 0)
head(data.frame(group = UN11$group, U1, U2, U3), 10)
```

Using the UN11 data frame:

- If an observation is in the first level, then it returns TRUE which when added to 0 gives 1.
- If an observation is not in the first level, then it returns FALSE which when added to 0 gives 0.
- Similar for the other groups.


- Using the UN11 data frame, if an observation is the first level, then it returns TRUE which when added to 0 gives 1.


## The one-factor model

Regression coefficients for factor variables in a one-way model are often called **effects**.

### 4. Let $Y$ denote the response variable `lifeExpF`. What would be problematic about using the linear model proposed below?

$$Y =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 U_1 + \beta_2 U_2 + \beta_3 U_3 + \epsilon$$
Since $U_1 + U_2 + U_3 =1$, the first column (intercept) of the model matrix is linearly dependent with the last three columns. Since the model matrix is not full rank, we would not be able to invert $X^TX$ and solve for the regression coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.

We only need $d-1$ dummy variables to represent $d$ levels because the last level represented when all the other dummy variables were 0.  

- Any of the $d$ dummy variables could be excluded, though generally it is the first or last level.
- R drops the first level by default.
- The level dropped is known as the **reference** or **baseline level**.
- In R, this method for creating the dummy variables is known as the **treatment contrast**.


Other possibilities for avoiding linear dependence are:  

- Drop $\beta_0$ from the model.
- Assume $\sum_{i=1}^{d-1} \beta_i = 0$.  

  - This is known as a **sum contrast** and does NOT use dummy variables.
  - Interpretation is generally more difficult.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Here we load libraries used in this file
# You may need to install if not already done so
library(alr4) #datasets from Weisberg text
library(ggplot2) #To make some pretty plots
library(lattice) #data visualization
library(HH) #datasets from text by Heiberger and Holland
```


```{r}
levels(UN11$group)
```

```{r}
U1 <- with(UN11, (group == levels(group)[1]) + 0) #oecd =1
U2 <- with(UN11, (group == levels(group)[2]) + 0) #other =1
U3 <- with(UN11, (group == levels(group)[3]) + 0) #africa =1
UN11$U1 = U1
UN11$U2 = U2
UN11$U3 = U3
lm(lifeExpF ~ U2 + U3, data = UN11)
```


# Factors and Quantitative Predictors

It is common to study the effect of a factor AFTER adjusting for one or more other quantitative regressors.  

If we have a mixture of factors and quantitative variables in our data, it’s useful to create a scatterplot of the response versus the covariate that distinguishes the observations for each level.

- This helps us assess whether the relationship between the response and quantitative regressor differs for the levels of the factor.

```{r}
# compute mean lifeExpF for each group
(mean_lifeExpF <- tapply(UN11$lifeExpF, UN11$group, mean))
```

## Exploratory Data Analsis with `ggplot2`

```{r}
ggplot(UN11, aes(x = log(ppgdp), y = lifeExpF, col = group, pch = group)) + geom_point()
```

## Exploratory Data Analsis with `lattice`

```{r}
# A similar plot using the lattice package
library(lattice)
xyplot(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11, group = group, auto.key = TRUE)
```

## Exploratory Data Analsis with Base Graphics

```{r}
# using base graphics
# create different colors/symbols for each group
grp_col = as.numeric(UN11$group)

# plot data, using different colors/symbols for each group
plot(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11, 
     col = grp_col, pch = grp_col)

# create the legend
legend("topleft", legend = c("oecd", "other", "africa"), col = 1:3, pch = 1:3)
```


### 1. What are some interesting observations/patterns you can see in the plots above?

We see:

- The linear relationship between `lifeExpF` and `log(ppgdp)` is fairly weak for the African countries
- The linear relationship is reasonably strong for the other countries
- The linear relationship is reasonably strong for OECD countries.
- It’s unclear whether the average rate of change between `lifeExpF` and `log(ppgdp)` (the slope) is the same for the three factor levels.
- The average `lifeExpF` seems to differ vertically for the same levels of `log(ppgdp)` for the different factor levels.


## Comparing Different Models

Suppose we have a response $Y$, a quantitative regressor $X$, and a two-level factor variable represented by a dummy variable $U$:

$$U = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
0 & \mbox{for the reference level} \\
1 & \mbox{for the treatment level} \end{array} \right.$$

Consider several possible regression models. Note models described extend naturally when the factor has more than 2 levels (as in our case).

- The same one regression line for both levels (combined), $Y= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$.  
  - In R: `y ~ x`
  - This is a **simple linear model**.

### 2. Enter code to fit a simple linear model with `log(ppgdp)` as the regressor and `lifeExpF` as the response.

```{r}
lmods <- lm(lifeExpF ~  log(ppgdp), data = UN11)
faraway::sumary(lmods)
```

- A factor predictor but no quantitative predictor, $Y= \beta_0 + \beta_2 U + \epsilon$.  
  - In R: `y ~ u`
  - This is a **one-way model**.

### 3. Enter code to fit a one-way model with `U2` and `U3` as the treatment levels and `lifeExpF` as the response.

```{r}
lmodo <- lm(lifeExpF ~  U2 + U3, data = UN11)
#lmodo2 <- lm(lifeExpF ~  group, data = UN11)
faraway::sumary(lmodo)
```

- Separate regression lines for each group having the same slope, $Y= \beta_0+ \beta_1 X+ \beta_2 U + \epsilon$.  
	- In R: `y ~ x + u`.
	- This is known as a **parallel lines** or **main effects model**.
	- $\beta_2$ represents the vertical distance between the regression lines (the effect of the treatment).

### 4. Enter code to fit a main effects model with `log(ppgdp)` as a predictor with `U2` and `U3` as the treatment levels and `lifeExpF` as the response.


```{r}
lmodm <- lm(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp) + U2 + U3, data = UN11)
#lmodm2 <- lm(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp) + group, data = UN11)
faraway::sumary(lmodm)
```

- Separate lines for each group with different slopes, $Y= \beta_0+ \beta_1 X+ \beta_2 U+ \beta_3 XU + \epsilon$.  
	- In R: `y ~ x + u + x:u` or `y ~ x*u`
	- This is known as a **separate lines** or **interaction model**.
	- `x:u` means the interaction between `x` and `u`.
	- `x*u` means the cross between `x` and `u` (`x`, `u`, and the interaction between `x` and `u`). 

### 5. Enter code to fit an interaction  model with `log(ppgdp)` as a predictor with `U2` and `U3` as the treatment levels and `lifeExpF` as the response

```{r}
lmodi <- lm(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp)*group, data = UN11)
faraway::sumary(lmodi)
```

```{r}
coef(lmods)
coef(lmodo)
coef(lmodm)
coef(lmodi)
```


## Model Matrix for the Interaction Model

```{r}
head(model.matrix(lmodi), 10)
```

### 6. How are the last two columns of $X$ computed?

The dummy variables are exactly like they were in the one-way model, but this model has additional regressors that are the product of the covariate and the dummy variables

### 7. Find formulas for E(lifeExpF $\vert$ ppgdp = x, group=oecd), E(lifeExpF $\vert$ ppgdp = x, group = other) and E(lifeExpF $\vert$ ppgdp = x, group = africa).

$$\begin{aligned} \widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} =& \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}, \mbox{group})\\
&= 59.21 + 2.24 \log{(\mbox{ppgdp})} -11.17 U_2 -22.98 U_3 + 0.93 \log{(\mbox{ppgdp})}U_2 + 1.09 \log{(\mbox{ppgdp})}U_3
\end{aligned}$$

If the group is oecd, then $U_2=0$ and $U_3=0$ giving

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} &= \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}=x, \mbox{group=oecd})\\
&= 59.21 + 2.24 \log{(x)}
\end{aligned}$$


If the group is other, then $U_2=1$ and $U_3=0$ giving

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} &= \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}=x, \mbox{group=other})\\
&= 59.21 + 2.24 \log{(x)} -11.17 + 0.93 \log{(x)}\\
&= 48.02 + 3.17 \log{(x)}
\end{aligned}$$

If the group is africa, then $U_2=0$ and $U_3=1$ giving

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} &= \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}=x, \mbox{group=africa})\\
&= 59.21 + 2.24 \log{(x)} -22.98 +1.09 \log{(x)}\\
&= 36.23 + 5.41 \log{(x)}
\end{aligned}$$

## Plotting the Interaction Model

```{r}
# using ggplot2
ggplot(UN11, aes(x = log(ppgdp), y = lifeExpF, col = group)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="top")
```

```{r}
# using lattice
xyplot(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11, 
       group = group, type = c("p", "r"), 
       auto.key = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# using base graphics
# create different colors/symbols for each group
grp_col = as.numeric(UN11$group)

# plot data, using different colors/symbols for each group
plot(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11, 
     col = grp_col, pch = grp_col)
# fitted lines for each group, 
# changing color for each group.  
# Make sure to match the color number with color number used in plot!
abline(59.21366, 2.24254, col = 1)
abline(59.21366 - 11.17310, 2.24254 + 0.92944, col = 2)
abline(59.21366 - 22.98484, 2.24254 + 1.09498, col = 3)

# create the legend
legend("topleft", legend = c("oecd", "other", "africa"), col = 1:3, pch = 1:3, lty = 1)
```


### 8. Interpret each coefficient in your previous formulas in the context of this dataset.

When **group = oecd** we have the following interpretations. For OECD countries:
 - For every $1\%$ increase in an OECD country's GDP per capita, the life expectancy of females is predicted to increase by about $0.0224$ years, on average.
 - If an OECD's country has GDP per capita equal to $\$1$, the life expectancy of females is predicted to be 59 years. 

When **group = other** we have the following interpretations. For OECD countries:
 - For every $1\%$ increase in an `other` country's GDP per capita, the life expectancy of females is predicted to increase by about $0.0317$ years, on average.
 - If an `other` country has GDP per capita equal to $\$1$, the life expectancy of females is predicted to be 48 years. 

When **group = africa** we have the following interpretations. For OECD countries:
 - For every $1\%$ increase in an African country's GDP per capita, the life expectancy of females is predicted to increase by about $0.0541$ years, on average.
 - If an African country has GDP per capita equal to $\$1$, the life expectancy of females is predicted to be 36 years. 

Comparing slopes in the the three models, we can see that if a country increases its GDP per capita by $1\%$, then the corresponding increase in life expectancy of females is greatest in Africa, second greatest in the `other` group, and least for OECD countries.

Note: The interpretation of the **intercept terms** for an interaction model **can be problematic in practice** because the size difference between the coefficients might not represent a typical difference **if the range of the quantitative regressor doesn’t include zero**.

## Interpreting Coefficients in the Interaction Model


**Interpretation is easier if we eliminate the interaction term.** One solution is to center the quantitative regressor at its mean and recompute the model.

- The intercept-related coefficients are interpreted as the effect when the regressor is at its mean value.

## Effects Plot for Interaction Model

```{r}
# Compute effects
ppgdpEffect <- Effect(c("ppgdp", "group"),
                     mod = lmodi,
                     xlevels = list(ppgdp = seq(1, 106000, len = 1000)))
# Plot the effects
# (multiline = TRUE) means all lines plotted on same graph 
plot(ppgdpEffect,
     multiline = TRUE)
```

## Effects Plot for Interaction Model with Log Scale

```{r}
plot(ppgdpEffect,
     rug=FALSE, grid=TRUE, multiline=TRUE,
     xlab = "log(ppgdp)",
     transform.x=list(ppgdp=list(trans=log, inverse=exp)),
     ticks.x =list(ppgdp = list(at= c(100, 1000, 5000, 30000))))
```

```{r}
#Another way to plot on log-scale
plot(ppgdpEffect, multiline=TRUE, grid=TRUE,rug=FALSE,
     axes=list(
       x=list(ppgdp=list(transform=list(trans=log, inverse=exp),
                        lab = "ppdgd, log-scale",
                        ticks=list(at=c(100,1000,5000,30000)),
                        lim = c(100,200000)
                         ))))
```

### 9. What are some interesting observations we can infer from the plot above?

- The increase in female life expectancy is greater for smaller starting values of ppgdp.
- The effect is generally largest for OECD locations, closely followed by other locations.

## Main Effects Model

A **main effects model assumes the slope is the same for all factor levels** but allows each group to have its own intercept.  

```{r}
lmodm <- lm(lifeExpF ~ log(ppgdp) + group, data = UN11)
faraway::sumary(lmodm)
```


### 10. Find formulas for E(lifeExpF $\vert$ ppgdp = x, group=oecd), E(lifeExpF $\vert$ ppgdp = x, group = other) and E(lifeExpF $\vert$ ppgdp = x, group = africa).


$$\begin{aligned} \widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} =& \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}, \mbox{group})\\
&= 49.53 + 3.18 \log{(\mbox{ppgdp})} -1.53 U_2 -12.17 U_3
\end{aligned}$$

If the group is oecd, then $U_2=0$ and $U_3=0$ giving

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} &= \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}=x, \mbox{group=oecd})\\
&= 49.53 + 3.18 \log{(x)}
\end{aligned}$$


If the group is other, then $U_2=1$ and $U_3=0$ giving

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} &= \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}=x, \mbox{group=other})\\
&= 49.53 + 3.18 \log{(\mbox{ppgdp})} -1.53(1) -12.17(0)\\
&= 48 + 3.18 \log{(x)}
\end{aligned}$$

If the group is africa, then $U_2=0$ and $U_3=1$ giving

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mbox{lifeExpF}} &= \widehat{\mbox{E}}(\mbox{lifeExpF} \vert \mbox{ppgdp}=x, \mbox{group=africa})\\
&= 49.53 + 3.18 \log{(\mbox{ppgdp})} -1.53(0) -12.17(1)\\
&= 37.36 + 3.18 \log{(x)}
\end{aligned}$$

- Main effects models are easier to interpret since the effect of the quantitative regressor is the same for all levels of the factor.
- This model is called the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) when the factor levels indicate a randomly assigned treatment for subjects.


## Plotting the Main Effects Model

```{r}
# using ggplot2

# this limits the line to the range of the observed data (avoiding extrapolation)
predx <- unlist(tapply(log(UN11$ppgdp), UN11$group, function(x) seq(min(x), max(x), len = 2)))

# associated group for each x-value

## Effects Plot for the Main Effects Model

Recall that the effects plot for the **interaction model** simply **shows a separate line for each combination of quantitative regressor and factor level because they interact and the effects cannot be separated**.

```{r}
# We have already seen this plot
# Compute effects
#ppgdpEffect <- Effect(c("ppgdp", "group"),
#                     mod = lmodi,
#                     xlevels = list(ppgdp = seq(1, 106000, len = #1000)))

# Plot the effects
plot(ppgdpEffect,
     rug=FALSE, grid=TRUE, multiline=TRUE,
     xlab = "log(ppgdp)",
     transform.x=list(ppgdp=list(trans=log, inverse=exp)),
     ticks.x =list(ppgdp = list(at= c(100, 1000, 5000, 30000))))
```

```{r}
#Another way to plot on log-scale
plot(ppgdpEffect, multiline=TRUE, grid=TRUE,rug=FALSE,
     axes=list(
       x=list(ppgdp=list(transform=list(trans=log, inverse=exp),
                        lab = "ppdgd, log-scale",
                        ticks=list(at=c(100,1000,5000,30000)),
                        lim = c(100,200000)
                         ))))
```

In the **main effects model**, the **effect of the factor level can be distinguished separately from the quantitative regressor**.

```{r}
# effect plot for log(ppgdp) by group
ppgdpEffect <- allEffects(mod = lmodm,
                     xlevels = list(ppgdp = seq(1, 106000, len = 1000)))

# effect plot of ppgdp on original scale for main effects model
plot(ppgdpEffect)
```

- The main effects model effects plot separates the effect of the factor (holding the regressor constant at its mean) and the effect of the regressor (which has only a single line since the effect is the same for all levels of the factor).

**Note:**

- The vertical bars/shading in each plot indicate +/- 1 standard error of the estimated effect size.
- The ppgdp effects plot is a weighted average of the fitted lines for the three levels of group.  
- The absolute scale doesn’t mean very much, but the shape is quite important.
