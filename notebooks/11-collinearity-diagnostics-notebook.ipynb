        "Collinearity is really only an issue when our goal is describing the relationship between the regressors and the response because collinearity make the estimated regression coefficients unstable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the goal of our analysis is prediction, then collinearity doesn’t need to be examined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatterjee and Hadi (2006) recommend examining collinearity after we come up with a suitable model (generally after variable selection and checking other assumptions related to structure and the errors).\n",
        "\n",
        "If we find that we should remove certain regressors from our model, then we may need to go through the variable selection process again.\n",
