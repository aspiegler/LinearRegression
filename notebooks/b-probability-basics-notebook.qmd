Probability attempts to quantify how frequently outcomes from a random experiment will occur.

The table below summarizes basic probability-related terminology.

| term         | notation              | definition                                                                           |
|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| experiment   | N/A                   | A mechanism that produces outcomes that cannot be predicted with absolute certainty. |
| outcome      | $\omega$              | The simplest kind of result produced by an experiment.                               |
| sample space | $\Omega$              | The set of all possible outcomes an experiment can produce.                          |
| event        | $A$, $A_i$, $B$, etc. | Any subset of $\Omega$.                                                              |
| empty set    | $\emptyset$           | The event that includes no outcomes.                                                 |

Some notes about the terms,

-   **Outcomes** are also known as **points**, **realizations**, or **elements**.
-   **Event:** a set of outcomes.
-   The **empty set** is a subset of $\Omega$ but not an outcome of $\Omega$.
-   The **empty set** is a subset of every event $A\subseteq \Omega$.

### Basic set operations

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events contained in $\Omega$.

The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of outcomes that are common to both $A$ and $B$,

-   Denoted $A \cap B$.
-   Set definition: $A \cap B = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A\;\mathrm{and}\;\omega \in B\}$.

Events $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** if $A\cap B = \emptyset$, i.e., if $A$ and $B$ have no common outcomes.

The **union** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of outcomes that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.

-   Denoted $A \cup B$.
-   Set definition: $A \cup B = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A\;\mathrm{or}\;\omega \in B\}$.

The **complement** of $A$ is the set of outcomes that are in $\Omega$ but are not in $A$.

-   Denoted $A^c$, $\overline{A}$, or $A'$.
-   Set definition: $A^c = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \not\in A\}$.

The set **difference** between $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements in $A$ that are not in $B$.

-   Denoted $A \setminus B$.
-   Set definition: $A\setminus B = \{\omega \in A: \omega \not\in B\}$.
-   The set difference between $A$ and $B$ may also be denoted by $A-B$.
-   The set difference is order specific, i.e., $(A\setminus B) \not= (B\setminus A)$ in general.

### Probability function

A **probability function** is a function $P$ that assigns a real number $P(A)$ to every event $A \subseteq \Omega$ and satisfies three properties:

1.  $P(A)\geq 0$ for all $A\subseteq \Omega$.
2.  $P(\Omega) = 1$. Alternatively, $P(\emptyset) = 0$. Informally, the probability that at least one of the possible outcomes in the sample space occurs is 1.
3.  If $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are disjoint, then $P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)$.

### Independence and conditional probability

A set of events $\{A_i:i\in I\}$ are **independent** if

$$
P\left(\cap_{i\in J} A_i \right)=\prod_{i\in J} P(A_i )
$$

for every finite subset $J\subseteq I$.

The **conditional probability** of $A$ given $B$, denoted as $P(A\mid B)$, is the probability that $A$ occurs given that $B$ has occurred, and is defined as

$$
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad P(B) > 0.
$$

### Additional probability results

Some additional well-known probability results:

-   **Complement rule**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$.
-   **Addition rule**: $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.
-   **Bayes' rule**: Assuming $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, then

$$
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}.
$$

-   **Law of Total Probability**: Let $B_1, B_2, \ldots$ be a countably infinite partition of $\Omega$. Then 

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A \cap B_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i).
$$
